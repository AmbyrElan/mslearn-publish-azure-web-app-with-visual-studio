# MS Learn Publish Azure web app with Visual Studio

I completed the [Publish a web app to Azure App Service with Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/publish-azure-web-app-with-visual-studio/) module on Microsoft Learn.

This module showed me how to create a new ASP.NET web app from scratch, publish the web app to Azure directly from Visual Studio, create an App Service app, update the app, and publish changes.
